# TODO: Fix Errors in serve.js

- [x] Fix the dataPath variable to point to the 'data' directory instead of 'data.json'
- [x] Correct the readProducts function to properly read and parse the JSON file without redefining dataPath
- [x] Define writeProducts as a separate function outside of readProducts
- [x] Move the app.get('/products') route outside of any function and ensure it's properly defined
- [x] Ensure all braces are balanced and the code has correct syntax
- [ ] Test the server by running it and checking the /products endpoint
