// framework (Node.js)
//Node.js is a web application framework built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is designed to build scalable network applications and allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), which simplifies the development process.
